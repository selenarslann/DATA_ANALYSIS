NLTK provides a list of commonly used stop words in various languages, which can be useful for natural language processing tasks such as text classification and text mining. To use NLTK's list of stop words in your Python code, you can use the nltk.corpus.stopwords module, which contains lists of stop words for different languages."

    "Lemmatization is the process of reducing a word to its base or root form. It is similar to stemming, but it takes into account the word's part-of-speech (POS) tag. This means that it uses the context of the word to determine its base form, rather than just removing common morphological affixes. For example, the lemma of the verb \"running\" would be \"run\", and the lemma of the noun \"dogs\" would be \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The lemmatization process is done by comparing the word and its POS tag to a dictionary of base forms, such as WordNet. The lemmatizer then replaces the word with its corresponding base form, if it's found in the dictionary. This process can be useful for text processing tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and machine learning, because it reduces the dimensionality of the data and makes it easier to compare different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common practice to perform POS tagging before lemmatization because the lemmatizer needs the POS tag information to determine the base form of a word. The POS tag provides a clue to the lemmatizer about whether the word is a noun, verb, adjective or adverb. This information is used to select the right lemma from the dictionary, which can be different depending on the POS tag. For example, \"running\" as verb and \"running\" as noun have different base form, \"run\" and \"running\" respectively."
